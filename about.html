    <h3>SKILLS AND HOBBIES</h3>
    <p>I'm not a typical tech geek. In addition to exploring algorithm and coding, I am interested in a wide range of disciplines 
        such as sociology, applied psychology, finance, astronomy, anthropology, poetry, geophysics, business administration and so on. </p>

    <p>I especially like to get in touch with all kinds of people, so be free to contact me (by email <strong>wuziyue@zju.edu.cn</strong>
        or wechat <strong>Tinky11131998</strong>). My hobbies include many kinds of sports such as swimming, biking, soccer and so on. Also,
        I especially like to go traveling, hiking or sharing all kinds of experiences with other people. Meanwhile, some sorts of musical instruments and photography are also my cup of tea.</p>

    <h3>WHY I LIKE DATA SCIENCE</h3>
    <p> There are several reasons for this question and the first of with is that I love to seek insight from data. I think I can follow the trends in business and society through massive data. To be the first person to find out secrets is really exhilarating.</p>

    <p> What's more, data serves products and customers, and enterprises need to use data to dig out commercial value. Meanwhile, the society needs to find ways to improve people's lives through data analysis. Data scientists are of great importance to companies and society.</P>

    <p> Finally, there are applications for data science in all walks of life. The job of data scientist requires comprehensive skills including modeling, business skills, organizing skills and so on. Also, it is convenient to understand different fields and communicate with various kinds of people, which fits my personality well.</p>
